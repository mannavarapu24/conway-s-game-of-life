<h2>RULES OF THE GAME</h2>

<p>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, which is caused by under population.</p>
<p>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</p>
<p>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</p>
<p>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</p>
<p>If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbours, it comes to live 
</p> 
<p>If a live cell has less than two live neighbours, it dies </p> 
<p>If a live cell has more than three live neighbours, it dies </p> 

<p>If a live cell has two or three live neighbours, it continues living life - Therefore by repeating the cycle over and over, these simple rules create interesting, often unpredictable pattern </p>
